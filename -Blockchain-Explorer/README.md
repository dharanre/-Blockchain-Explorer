Building a Blockchain Explorer

# Blockchain Web Application

This is a README file for a basic web application project that allows candidates to create a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display information about a blockchain. Additionally, candidates are provided with a simple blockchain dataset (sample or testnet data) that includes blocks, transactions, and transaction details. The candidates' task is to use this data to populate their web application and implement specific features.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a web application that visualizes a blockchain and its contents. Candidates are expected to implement the following features in their web application:

1. **Block List**: Display a list of blocks in the blockchain, showing their index, timestamp, and hash.

2. **Transaction List**: When a user clicks on a block in the Block List, display a list of transactions within that block, showing transaction IDs and any relevant information.

3. **Transaction Details**: When a user clicks on a transaction in the Transaction List, show detailed information about that transaction, including sender, receiver, amount, and any additional data.

## Technologies

the following technologies to build the web application:

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing interactivity and functionality.
- **Blockchain Data**: Use the provided blockchain dataset or generate a sample dataset to populate the web application.
